- [ ] Create a Powerup the Player can grab that spawns two additional Balls for the current level
    - [ ] Add a Powerup class to the game
    - [ ] Spawn a powerup randomly
    - [ ] Make the powerup gradually descend toward the player
    - [ ] Add collision detection for when the powerup hits the Paddle
    - [ ] When the powerup hits the Paddle, spawn two additional Balls that behave identically to the original
    - [ ] Keep track of scoring points for the player
    - [ ] When the player wins and proceeds to the VictoryState for their current level, reset the number of active Balls to one
- [ ] Add growing and shrinking to the Paddle when the Player gains enough points or lose lives
    - Grow and shrink the Paddle such that it’s no longer just one fixed size forever. In particular, the Paddle should shrink if the player loses a heart (but no smaller of course than the smallest paddle size) and should grow if the player exceeds a certain amount of score (but no larger than the largest Paddle). This may not make the game completely balanced once the Paddle is sufficiently large, but it will be a great way to get comfortable interacting with Quads and all of the tables we have allocated for them in main.lua!
- [ ] Add locked blocks and key drops to spice up the level generation.
    - Add a locked Brick (located in the sprite sheet) to the level spawning, as well as a key powerup (also in the sprite sheet). The locked Brick should not be breakable by the ball normally, unless they of course have the key Powerup! The key Powerup should spawn randomly just like the Ball Powerup and descend toward the bottom of the screen just the same, where the Paddle has the chance to collide with it and pick it up. You’ll need to take a closer look at the LevelMaker class to see how we could implement the locked Brick into the level generation. Not every level needs to have locked Bricks; just include them occasionally! Perhaps make them worth a lot more points as well in order to compel their design. Note that this feature will require changes to several parts of the code, including even splitting up the sprite sheet into Bricks!
